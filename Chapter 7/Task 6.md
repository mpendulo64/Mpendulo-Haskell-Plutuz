HC17T6: Define a function maxSeverity that combines a list of Severity values using mconcat.
---


```haskell
-- Define Severity levels
data Severity = Low | Medium | High | Critical
    deriving (Eq, Show, Ord)

-- Semigroup instance: higher severity overrides lower one
instance Semigroup Severity where
    (<>) = max

-- Monoid instance: identity is Low (least severe)
instance Monoid Severity where
    mempty = Low
    mappend = (<>)

-- Function to compute the highest severity from a list
maxSeverity :: [Severity] -> Severity
maxSeverity = mconcat  -- Combines all using Monoid logic

-- Example usage
main :: IO ()
main = do
    let severities = [Low, Medium, High, Critical, Medium]
    putStrLn $ "ðŸš¨ Max severity: " ++ show (maxSeverity severities)
```

### ðŸ§  Explanation

- **`Semigroup`**: Uses `max`, so when two severities are combined, the higher one wins.
- **`Monoid`**:
  - Uses `Low` as identity (`mempty`) so it doesnâ€™t raise severity if encountered.
- **`maxSeverity`**:
  - Uses `mconcat` to fold the entire list of severities using the Monoid rulesâ€”yielding the highest severity overall.
