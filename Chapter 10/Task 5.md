data User = User
    { name  :: String
    , email :: String
    , age   :: Int
    } deriving Show

-- Define the ShowDetailed type class
class ShowDetailed a where
    showDetailed :: a -> String

-- Implement ShowDetailed for User
instance ShowDetailed User where
    showDetailed (User n e a) =
        "User Profile\n" ++
        "Name: " ++ n ++ "\n" ++
        "Email: " ++ e ++ "\n" ++
        "Age: " ++ show a
