### ðŸ§  Explanation

- **`main :: IO ()`**  
  Declares the main entry point for an executable Haskell program. It performs input/output actions.

- **`putStrLn "..."`**  
  Prints a message to the console. The first `putStrLn` asks the user for their name.

- **`getLine`**  
  Reads a line of input from the user and binds it to the variable `name`.

- **`putStrLn $ "Hello, " ++ name ++ ...`**  
  Concatenates the greeting message and prints it.
